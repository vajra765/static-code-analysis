# Reflection on Static Code Analysis Lab

## What I Learned
This lab helped me see why static code analysis is so useful in programming. Using tools like Pylint, Bandit, and Flake8, I was able to find problems in my code before running it. These tools pointed out issues like unsafe coding practices, missing comments, and style mistakes, which I might have missed otherwise.

## What Was Easy and What Was Hard
Fixing some issues, like changing function names to the right style and removing unused imports, was pretty straightforward. But handling unsafe code like the bare except clause and replacing the use of eval was more challenging because it required me to think carefully about how to keep the code safe and still working correctly.

## How This Will Help Me
Now I understand the benefits of regularly using static analysis tools. They help catch bugs early, improve security, and make the code easier to read and maintain. I plan to include these tools in my future projects and use their feedback to write better code from the start.

## Final Thoughts
This lab showed me that writing code is not just about making it work, but also about making it safe, clean, and professional. Static analysis tools are an important part of that process and help improve the quality of software significantly.
